## Plugins Used

**Table Sorter**
Link: http://tablesorter.com/docs/
This plugin was used for the longer tables, specifically Co-Op and Employment tables to make sorting easier

**Anchor Scroll**
Link: http://www.virgiliudiaconu.com/work/anchor-scroll/
This plugin was used to smooth the transition when clicking on the anchor links in the nav to scroll down to a section. Since this was a single page site I wanted to make sure the transition from section to section was smooth in terms of motion.

**Flip**

This plugin was used for the degrees and staff grids where when clicked on the div will animate a flip to show the div behind with other information.

**Popup**
Link: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
This plugin was used for the dialog popup boxes with the research categories and contact form.

**Sticky**
Link: http://stickyjs.com/
This plugin was used with the navigation bar to make sure it is always at the top of the page. When the page loads it is near the bottom, but this plugin helped to control when it is sticky and when it is not.

**Sticky Table Headers**
Link: https://github.com/jmosbech/StickyTableHeaders
This plugin was used on the two longer tables, Co-Op Info and Emplyment info to help when the user scrolls to always see the table header to be aware of the row and column categories.

**Tabs**
Link: http://vdw.github.io/Tabslet/
This plugin was used in the resource section to show and hide contents by using tabs for each subsection such as study abroad, student services, forms etc.

**Read More**
Link: http://jedfoster.com/Readmore.js/
This plugin was used in the News section to truncate the news stories and allow the user to read more or less by clicking the button.

**Scroll Reveal**
Link: https://scrollrevealjs.org/
This plugin was used across the page to help with loading and create appealing transitions as the user scrolls down the page from section to section.
